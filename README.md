5. A `.geojson` file useful for data visualization

## 2. How to use this repository

*Data in this repository can be used to communicate the varying obesity rates of Denvers different neighborhoods*

The data in this repository is very useful and can be manipulated in many ways.

- If you have no experience with manipulation of data using Python, you should start with the python notbeook.
- If you would like to see that original data, access the OriginalData folder

This repository was created for Dr. Gotzler's ENGL105 class, and would not be possible without his teaching.

Original data comes from the [Denver Open Data Catalog.](https://denvergov.org/opendata) There are many more useful datasets that can be accessed and manipulated there. 

The `.geojson` file is from another GitHub repository, linked [here.](https://github.com/blackmad/neighborhoods/blob/master/denver.geojson) This is an excellent resource for daata visualizaiton at the city scale. 

Data visualizations were created with [Datawrapper](https://app.datawrapper.de/)
